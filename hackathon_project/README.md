Title:- Enhancing Internship Opportunities for Students through Skill-Based Profiling and Task Evaluation not for Job.


**Problem Statement :-**

The transition from academic learning to professional employment is a significant challenge for many students. Securing internships, which provide real-world experience and enhance employability, often depends on the visibility of the student’s skills and accomplishments to potential employers.

Currently, students create profiles on professional networking sites like LinkedIn, but these profiles may not adequately highlight the specific skills and competencies that are relevant to employers. Moreover, there is a lack of a robust mechanism to verify the authenticity of the skills claimed by the students.

In this hackathon, we aim to address these issues by developing an innovative solution that not only helps students create detailed skill-based profiles but also provides them with tasks, tests, and projects related to their skills. The solution should include an algorithm that checks the correctness, detects cheating, and identifies plagiarism in these tasks.

The performance of the students on these tasks will be recognized through badges and remarks, providing companies with a more accurate representation of the student’s abilities. Furthermore, the solution should also recommend companies to students based on their skills and vice versa.

This solution will be particularly beneficial for students seeking research-based or technical internships, where specific technical competencies and innovative thinking are highly valued.

**Solution**

We wanted to solve this problem so firstly we asked our friends who are facing problems in finding internships and what solution can be there for this. From this we had an idea what we have to do. Now to do something unique we started exploring platforms providing internships. So we decided to ask our user to fill a CV form where we ask questions regarding students and details required for an internship. We also ask companies to fill another form where they tell us in which field internship is available and what are its requirements.

**Our features** :-

1. Skill-based Profile Creation:-

  We create a student profile with detailed questions and answers with users. This feature is present in all other platforms.

2. Task Assignment:-

  We provide tasks, projects, tests to help students more and help them to get internships easily as they are generally provided by the company or nearly similar questions. These things are not present in all platforms. Something is present but not up to level.

3. Performance Evaluation:-

  Since students have done tasks, projects, tests we will evaluate their performance and suggest to them where they can improve themself and this report will be shared with the companies as mostly questions will be from the company or on the project they are working on.

4. Recognition of Achievement:-

  We will provide some badges and gift vouchers to the students who are regularly performing some task projects, tests and want to do something big. This can be  useful for student as we will be able to say that this student completes it task on time and serious about learning new things

5. Company-Student Matching:-

  Since we have to suggest companies to students and students to companies, we use our algorithm for this. Algorithms contain many parameters and most of them will be as per companies requirement and some will be as per our criteria. So through this we are going to find the best match and suggest them respectively. This part is not provided on all platforms. As most of them are for jobs, not for internships.

6. Suitability for Research-Based Internships:-

  Research internship is a field where finding an internship is quite difficult so we will help students to connect organisations who provide research internships. To get selected for this we will give you research base projects where you have to do research to become familiar with this and get an internship easily. These internships can be in other countries. If you are new to research then will guide you a little more by providing additional resources for this.

With the help of above features we create a user friendly and different platform from the platform avalable.

If both student and company agree that they can work together then other formalities will be done. After completion of internship if both student and company are satisfied and happy then we can say that we have done our work successfully.
